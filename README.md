# Simple Voice Chat Music Player

Enjoy music with your friends. This mod allows you to stream youtube, soundcloud, bandcamp, vimeo, twitch, mp3, flac, wav, m3u, and more into SimpleVoiceChat groups.
Powered by the lightweight [lavaplayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer) library.

## Commands

- `/music play <song>` - Searches and queues the first result
- `/music search <song>` - Lists all results and lets you choose which you want to queue
- `/music now-playing` - Shows the current song
- `/music queue` - Shows the queue
- `/music skip` - Skips the current song

## Customization

Currently, no options are customizable as this was made for private use, but I thought I'd open-source it since
others may find it useful.

Feel free to PR a refactor that adds in more customization.
